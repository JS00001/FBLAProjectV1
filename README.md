## üöÄ Problem
You have been hired by your state or local area‚Äôs tourism bureau to develop a program that suggests attractions (can be tourist attractions, restaurants, shopping, things to do, etc.) to potential visitors. Your program will allow users to search for attractions in the area based on desired attributes, such as location, type of attraction, and amenities. Your program must include at least 50 attractions, and users must be able to define at least five desired attributes to search for an attraction.


## üî® Setup

**Installation**
1. Download the latest release from https://github.com/JS00001/fbla-project-exe/releases
2. Run the executable from the release files.
3. Running the executable will install the program as `Athens Attractions`
4. Upon first install, the program will automatically run.
5. Use the program to find new attractions.


**Building From the Source Code**
1. Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install the runtime. 
2. Download the source code of the repository.
3. Move the files into a folder, and open a command prompt in the folder.
4. Run `npm install`
5. Once all dependencies are installed, run `npm run build`
6. A folder named `dist` will be created it, inside of it will be the compiled program, `Athens Attactions x.x.x install.exe`
